# UMSCC-Histogram-Analysis
Data and select code snippets from manuscript on histogram analysis of radiation resistance in UMSCC sections.

All data to recreate any figure and reperform any analysis is available. For bulk averages, pixel-wise averages of images are included (in both whole-section and ROI cases). In cases of multivariate histograms, data for highest order histograms has been included that allows for the flattening into lower-order histograms. Histogram tables for regions of multivariate histograms have also been included for convenience.
